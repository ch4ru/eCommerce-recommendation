# eCommerce Recommendation System

## Tools Used
- Sentence Transformers
- Elasticsearch
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Flask

## Project Description
Developed a recommendation system to suggest products based on user preferences and product similarities. The system uses **Sentence Transformers** to generate semantic embeddings for product descriptions and titles. These embeddings are indexed in **Elasticsearch** for fast retrieval. **scikit-learn** calculates cosine similarity between product embeddings, ranking them based on similarity. A **Flask API** is used to provide real-time recommendations to users.

## My Role
- Designed and implemented the embedding generation pipeline using **Sentence Transformers**.
- Cleaned and processed product data using **Pandas** to ensure data consistency.
- Indexed product embeddings in **Elasticsearch** for fast querying and retrieval.
- Calculated product similarity using **scikit-learn** and ranked recommendations.
- Developed a **Flask API** to serve real-time product recommendations to users.
